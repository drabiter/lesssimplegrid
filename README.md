# LessSimpleGrid

LSG is built from Simple-Grid as stone foundation with couple additional things like buttons, spaces, offsets, etc which I think important in quick web mock up.

## Usage
Grab `build/style.min.css` from this repository or follow [this link](http://drabiter.com/lesssimplegrid/build/style.min.css).

##Demo
[LSG's page](http://drabiter.com/lesssimplegrid) shows all of them.
