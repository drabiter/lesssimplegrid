# LessSimpleGrid

LSG is built from Simple-Grid as foundation with additional things like buttons, alignments, floating, spacing, visibility, and column offsets.

## Usage
Grab `build/style.min.css` from this repository or follow [this link](http://drabiter.github.io/lesssimplegrid/build/style.min.css).

## Contributing
I am not a CSS wizard or LESS dragon-rider but please follow my style (if it hurts your philosophy, forgive me) and edit the `style.less` file only.

##Demo
Visit [LSG's github page](http://drabiter.com/lesssimplegrid) to see all features in action.
